### Fermion to Spin Transforms via Encoding Graphs

This package is meant to make it easy to examine different encodings of fermion operators to qubit qubit operators, and importantly the inverse mappings. It also is being built up to more generally aid in the study of mapping between Spin and Fermionic Hamiltonians. For relevant files and See `ez_inv_maps_master`. For basic and more advanced usage examples, see `Encoding_Example.py` and `Hamiltonian_Example.py`.
